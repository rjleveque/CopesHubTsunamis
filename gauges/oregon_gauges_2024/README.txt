New gauge locations provided by Claudia Reis Sept 5, 2024

The script make_gauges_csv.py was used to convert the .xlsx files to .csv
files that have the gauges centered in 1/3" cells, and with lat-lon in
decimal degrees.  It also creates a kml file that shows the original (red)
and shifted (yellow) gauge locations.

make_gauges_output.txt gives the screen output written during the
conversion, which tells how much each gauge was shifted.
