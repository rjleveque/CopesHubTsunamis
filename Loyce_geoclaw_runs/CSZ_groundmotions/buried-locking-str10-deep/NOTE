Done:   5" off shore roughly +_32.2km around Westport. This
   5" extends west for 300 seconds initially to capture the deformation.
   These 5" rectangular regions are inside the Coastal RRs below.

   All output stored in _plots_with5sec, _output_with5sec

   Well, the 5" makes a big difference.  The source's peak is narrow it seems.

Could run:  5" off shore roughly +-32.2km around Westport without the
   5" extenstion west for 300 seconds initially.  This one 5" rectangular
   region is inside the Coastal RRs below.  (Not doing yet.)

Next to run: 30" to 15" variable Coastal RR, and 15" fixed Coastal RR
   for 300 seconds initially to start the deformation.
   Done

Compare the 5 vs 15:
   Well, the 5" makes a big difference.  The source's peak is narrow it seems.
   We think we need the 5" around the source area as well as the gauges.

Now doing an experiment:
   Running 15" again, this time for 45 minutes.  Have the outer Coastal region
on for tmax_dtopo is 15 minutes, rather than 300 sec.  Also addeded a 15" rectangular
region like the 5" one that goes from the inner Coastal region to shore that is
4,4 always, so the gauge plots in a fixed region and this is our sliver of interest.
Also outputting every 5 minutes, so get 9 plots.  Will see if the tsunami clears the
region between the two Coastal areas in this 15 minute period and if the Coastal
regions are good enough to capture the source.

   Result:  Got the same amplitude maximums for the 15" (using tmax=300sec) vs. using
            tmax = 15 minutes.  Max graphs on topo of each other.  Hinting at the
            problem being the wave steepening as it propogates.  Going to now look at
            the time series plots to see if they are nearly the same.

   Result: (Time Series)  As we go further south (rupture was north to south), it is
           starting to matter that the region was let go after 5 minutes.  

Now doing another experiment:
    Want to compare holding on the the outer Coastal rectangle as a 15" region, and
    having the 5sec rectangle from time 0 to infinity. Then compare to old 5sec run which
    had 5sec resolution in inner and outer coastal for 300sec and then 5sec in inner coastal
    for the rest.  (Is the need for 5sec due to the wave at the gauge being steeper?)
    (Can we do 15 around the source until it comes into the inner slider?)
    which had 5 minutes on outer Coastal at 
    this change over holding on to it for just 300 seconds? 

    Answer:  Using 15sec in the outer Coastal region is fine.  Start the inner region at time 0
    to infinity at 5sec resolution.  The wave steepens up as it comes onto the shelf near the
    gauges and 5sec resolution (at least more than 15sec) is needed.  I could try 10sec resolution
    for the inner resolution, but haven't done that yet.  Kind of feel we should stick with 5sec.
    
Now doing a last experiment:
    Can 5sec in the slider inner window, be reduced to 10"?  Started with changing the refinement
    to go from 30 to 10 to 5.  Not using the 5 for this experiment.  30 is still level 3, and 10
    is level 4.  Then have an inner slider at 4,4 for all time. Using 10,10 for the outer as well
    but just for 15 minutes, then let it go.  Want to see how that compares to 15" in the outer 
    coastal for 15 minutes, then 5sec in the inner coastal for all time.  That is do we need the
    5sec?

    Well, 10",10" for 900 sec and 10",30" in the outer after 900 sec gets the peaks better that 
    15",15" for 900 sec and 15",30" in the outer after 900 sec  as one would expect.  They are
    however, pretty close, biggest difference is at the peaks for the gauges outside our slider.
   
    The 5",5" slider is probably needed instead of the 10",10" slider around the gauges of
    interest.  There are some gauges of interest where difference is now around 1 meter rather
    than the 2 meter difference if we used a 15",15" slider.  We could keep going and see how
    4",4" slider would compare to 5",5" or we could stop and adopt the following:

         THE PLAN:

         Use 15" DEM everywhere for the noninundation part.  All these comparisons were with
         the 15" DEM.  (I think that is the best we have.)  Then use the following:

         outer big coastal RR:  10",10" for 20 minutes then let it go. (This includes inner coastal RR.)
         inner coastal RR:      30",10" starting at 20 minutes to infinity.
         slider around around gauges of interest (sliver of the inner coastal RR): 5",5" all time

         So, for our region around a community (roughly +-32.2 km in latitude) we are computing in
         an area around the community's gauges of interest at the 5" level in a fixed region.  The
         tsunami comes to this region from level 10",10" computation in the big outer RR which also
         includes the inner coastal RR, and the slider 5",5" described below.  Simulations show
         20 minutes is enough time for the waves travelling toward shore to all enter this
         5",5" fixed region.  Then the 10",10" outer region is let go.  The remaining Coastal inner RR
         is 30",10" except for the slider which remains at 5",5".  The values of gauges outside
         the slider area are computed on another job run with a different slider.
