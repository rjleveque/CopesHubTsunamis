Need to check all this!

JOB RUNS:
--------

_output_15sec: outer and inner coastal on at 15",15" for 300sec;  inner coastal for 30",15 onward; No slider.
_plots_15sec:

_output_with5sec: Same as _output_15sec with addition of 5",5" slider in inner and outer for first 300sec
                  and then inner for the rest.
_plots_with5sec:

_output15DEM_15tmax15Grid: outer and inner coastal on at 15",15" for 900sec; inner coastal for 30",15 onward.
                           Also had a 15",15" slider inner region from 900sec to end.  (Should have been from
                           0sec to the end, but probably doesn't matter since the underlying coastal was 30",15"
                           which allowed for 15".   
_plots_15tmax15Grid

_output15DEM_5innerGrid:  outer and inner coastal on at 15",15" for 900sec; inner coastal for 30",15 onward.
                          5",5" inner slider for all time.  No slider in outer. Means can use 15" in outer 
                          (but not inner) for 900sec then let go.  Using 5" slider inner only.
_plots15DEM_5innerGrid:

_output_10sec:            outer and inner coastal on at 10",10" for 900sec; inner coastal for 30",10" onward.
                          10:,10" inner slider for all time.  No slider in outer. Investigating whether can
                          use 10" computational grid around gauges in the inner and use 10" in the outer and
                          let that go after 900sec.  Using 10" slider inner only.
_plots_10sec:

_output_5sec:             This is the level 5 run (5sec is level 5) when 10sec is level 4.
                          Keeping outer for 900sec.  5sec slider just covering inner coastal RR around Westport.
_plots_5sec:


COMPARISONS:
-----------

_plots_5vs15: _output_with5sec, _output_15sec
              Shows that 5sec calculation can give as much as around 2 meter more amplitude
              for some gauges when we compute with 5 in the inner and let go the outer region
              after 300sec.  (Main thing is the computation as evidenced by  more experiments
              below.)

_plots_5inner_vs_5: Compares _output15DEM_5innerGrid, _output_with5sec
                    Shows the outer coastal can be at 15", but the inner coastal has to be
                    finer around the gauges.

_plots_5vs15vs15tmax15: Compares _output_with5sec, _output_15sec, _output15DEM_15tmax15Grid
                        (Shows the 2 15" ones almost identical except for gauges further south where
                         giving up the outer coastal after 300sec is a bad idea.  Need it for at least 900
                         sec in the south and maybe a bit longer.  The difference to the with5sec one is
                         in the computation around the gauges.

_plots_5inner_vs_10: Compares _output15DEM_5innerGrid with _output_10ssec

_plots_5_vs_5inner_vs_10: Compares level 5 (5sec) to level 4 (10sec). Using output_10sec and _output_5sec above.
                          Also compares to 5inner which used 15sec outside instead of 10, I believe.
